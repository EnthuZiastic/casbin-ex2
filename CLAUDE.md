- This project is an Elixir version of ../casbin written in Golang
- When migrating from Golang to Elixir make sure to use same or similar names for modules, functions, tests, etc as far as possible. The only difference should be Elixirâ€™s snake_case naming style.
- Make sure to have similarly named functions in Elixir when taking reference from the Golang reference project in ../casbin. Keep the structure parallel to maintain familiarity between both codebases.
- After each coding session, always: 1) Run mix format to correctly format the code, 2) Run mix credo --strict and fix all issues flagged by the linter, 3) Run mix test to check for failing tests and fix any issues immediately.
